# This is my React Front end project for making reset buttons
<hr>
This website contains buttons for resetting data that is being scratched from nseindia.com for studying the NSE Trade Market

You can customize this according to your need by just adding your env file, and changing endpoints that are mentioned in the app.jsx file. I am making this repository public for everyone to try and use this according to their project.

<ul>
  <li> Fork and clone the project</li>
  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/SimplyAditya/nse-reset-links.git
  ```

 <li>Install the dependencies</li>

 ```
npm install
```

<li>Start the project using the npm script</li>

```
npm run dev
```

</ul>

Make sure to add your env file and also fill the **VITE_URL**
